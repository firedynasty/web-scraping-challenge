# web-scraping-challenge

## Intro

In this assignment, we are told to build a webscraping flask app that will call information that was scraped from a website about Mars.  The first headline and first paragaph of the news was obtained. An image was obtained for the landing page.  A table of Mars information was obtained using Pandas from a table on their website.  Images of the hemispheres of Mars were obtained.
